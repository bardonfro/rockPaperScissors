# Readme: Rock, Paper, Scissors
by github.com/bardonfro

## Purpose
This project was created during the [DOM Manipulation](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation) lesson at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Design Method
I've been toying with HTML and CSS for more than a decade, but never seriously. I'm a newbie with coding. This is the first project I've ever done that actually put the two together. Therefore, I was going for simplicity. I'm not sure I succeeded.

## Problems
I think my code is too wordy. I'm working on that. I've also never written a github readme before, so this is fun. If someone ever reads this I'll eat my hat.

## License
People say there's supposed to be a license. Following is mine. I call it the BFcpL (bardonfro's crazy people license):

> Anyone who wants to use any part of this code, even for inspiration, is first required to see a psychiatrist. This is not good code.
